# Image Editor (WIP)
This is something I wrote on my own time.  
After a vacation I would have way too many photos and I would want to downsize them to throw into my Google Photo albums and not exhaust my limited storage space.  
Photoshop actions is a good way to do it and how I've been doing it.  
But I decided to make this tool to also act as a refresh of Python for myself and get more practice into PySide6, threading, logging and pillow.

# NOTE THIS!
This tool is currently a WIP.  It is not complete yet.
